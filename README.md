# Personal website v2

I'm rebuilding my personal website (musicbyjing.com) into a simple gallery that will showcase my photographs grouped by theme. Clicking on a theme will show the pictures in that category, along with an option to return to the homepage.

To Do:

- [ ] Add `filter` to `photos` array in `photos.js` to properly select a gallery
- [ ] Add About page
- [ ] Add text color logic based on background color?
- [x] Add theme choices at the bottom of each gallery page
- [x] Fix imports in `photos.js`
- [x] Add back button in `MyGallery.js`
